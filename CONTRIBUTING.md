# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving Universal Manga Downloader! This project thrives on community-driven plugins and quality contributions. The guidelines below help us keep the codebase maintainable, type-safe, and respectful of the non-commercial spirit of the project.

## üß≠ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-change
   ```
3. Install dependencies into a Python 3.11 virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install ruff mypy pytest black
   ```
4. Configure the repo for pre-commit hooks or formatting tools you rely on (optional but encouraged).

## üîå Plugin Development

Plugins live in the `plugins/` directory and are auto-discovered at runtime. The application ships with a loader that scans for `.py` files (excluding `__init__.py` and hidden files) and registers each plugin safely using `importlib`.

### Parser Plugins

- Subclass `BasePlugin` from `plugins.base`.
- Implement the required methods:
  - `get_name(self) -> str`
  - `can_handle(self, url: str) -> bool`
  - `parse(self, soup: BeautifulSoup, url: str) -> ParsedChapter | None`
- Optional lifecycle hooks:
  - `on_load(self) -> None`
  - `on_unload(self) -> None`
- Return sanitized titles/chapters using `BasePlugin.sanitize_filename` to avoid filesystem issues.

### Converter Plugins

- Subclass `BaseConverter` from `plugins.base`.
- Implement:
  - `get_name(self) -> str`
  - `get_output_extension(self) -> str`
  - `convert(self, image_files: Sequence[Path], output_dir: Path, metadata: ChapterMetadata) -> Path | None`
- Use the `ChapterMetadata` TypedDict to name files consistently.
- Report failures via exceptions or `None`; the GUI surfaces log messages for users.

### Non-Commercial Requirement

All plugins **must** comply with the repository‚Äôs CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license:
- No telemetry, tracking pixels, advertising SDKs, or monetization logic.
- Do not embed API keys or secrets‚Äîuse environment variables or documentation instead.
- Cite any third-party datasets or code you adapt.

## üß™ Testing & Quality Gates

Before opening a pull request, run the full suite of checks from the project root:

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
pytest -v
```

- Keep code type-hinted (PEP 484) and follow PEP 8 formatting. We recommend `black` for consistent formatting.
- Fix or locally suppress lint findings; avoid disabling lints globally.
- Add or update tests when you introduce new behavior (e.g., new plugin types or GUI features).

## üìÆ Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up-to-date** with the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all quality checks** and ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   mypy .
   pytest
   ```

3. **Update documentation** when behavior changes:
   - `README.md` for user-facing changes
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` for development workflow changes
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural changes
   - `PLUGINS.md` for plugin API changes
   - Add docstrings and comments for complex code

4. **Write a clear PR description** using the provided template:
   - **Summary**: What does this PR do?
   - **Motivation**: Why is this change needed?
   - **Testing**: How did you test this? Include steps to reproduce
   - **Screenshots**: If applicable, for UI changes
   - **Breaking Changes**: If any, list them clearly
   - **Related Issues**: Link to issues this PR addresses

5. **Follow commit message conventions**:
   ```
   feat: Add EPUB converter plugin
   fix: Resolve race condition in queue manager
   docs: Update architecture documentation
   refactor: Extract UI helpers into utils module
   test: Add tests for queue state transitions
   ```

6. **Link to related issues**: Use keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"

7. **Submit the PR** and be responsive to reviewer feedback

8. **Wait for approval**: Maintainers will review and may request changes

## ü§ù Community Expectations

- Be respectful in issues and PR discussions.
- Prefer modular, testable designs; large GUI changes should be broken into focused commits.
- When in doubt, open an issue to discuss ideas before investing significant effort.

We appreciate every contribution‚Äîthank you for helping us build a universal, community-first manga downloader!
