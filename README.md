## Before You Start: The Only Prerequisite

The **only** thing you need is **Python 3**.

#### How to check if Python 3 is installed?

Open your "Terminal" or "Command Prompt" and type `python3 --version` (or `python --version`). If you see a version number, you're ready. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), ensuring you check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

3.  Unzip the downloaded file.

#### Step 2: Find and Run the Script
1.  Open the unzipped folder.
2.  **Open a terminal in this folder**:
    -   **Windows**: Type `cmd` in the folder's address bar and press Enter.

## For Developers: How to Add a New Parser

See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for environment setup, linting, and type-checking instructions before contributing changes.

This tool's strength is its modularity. To support a new website, you don't need to touch the main application.

1.  **Create a new parser file** in the `/parsers` directory (e.g., `my_site_parser.py`).
2.  **Create a parser class** that inherits from `BaseParser`.
3.  **Implement the `can_parse` and `parse` methods**:
    -   `can_parse(soup, url)`: A quick check to see if your parser can handle the page (e.g., check for a unique HTML tag or URL pattern).
    -   `parse(soup, url)`: The core logic to extract the `title`, `chapter`, and a list of `image_urls`. It should return a dictionary with these keys.
4.  **Done!** The main script will automatically detect and use your new parser.

## Troubleshooting

-   **"No suitable parser found"**: This means the URL is from a website or a page layout that is not yet supported.
-   **Window flashes and disappears**: Check the terminal for error messages.
-   **Download fails**: Check your internet connection and the URL.
